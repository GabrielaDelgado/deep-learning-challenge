Deep Learning Challenge

Contributor: Gabriela Delgado

Overview

This project was meant to create a training model through machine learning and neural networks. This model is supposed to predict whether applicants would be successfull if funded by a Nonprofit. 

This project includes a jupyter notebook document with the code for the model and a ReadMe file for context about this repository.

Git Bash

I used GitBash to download the repository to my desktop and push and commit the changes made to the code into the repository

Jupyter Notebook & Google Colaboratory

These programs were used to write and run the code for the machine learning model. The model should work on the platform of prefernce but it is more ocnvenient to use Google Colaboratory that will create the Jupyter notebook there.

Using Jupyter Notebook, a training model to make predictions was built using the X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test model after preprocessing the data to fit the model requirements.
